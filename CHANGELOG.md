## [0.10.0-beta] - 2026-02-28

### Added

- **Agent Memory & Sessions**: Implemented long-term memory for agents and chat session management. Features include a client-side history UI and server-side memory tools (core memories and notes).
- **Agent Reasoning Display**: The chatbot UI now displays the agent's detailed reasoning process and tool calls, including inputs and outputs.
- **Browser Agent Capabilities**: Extended agent orchestration by equipping the browser agent with tools for navigation, interaction, extraction, and screenshot functionalities.
- **Multi-Database Architecture**: Migrated metadata and API keys into their own separate SQLite databases for improved isolation and standardized database columns to `snake_case`.

### Changed

- **Agent Orchestration**: Enhanced sub-agent communication by instructing them to summarize findings, which the orchestrator then processes. Removed `any` type casts for better type safety with `LanguageModel`.
- **Backend Architecture**: Major refactoring of the backend directory structure. Centralized database utilities under `db/`, organized MCP components and REST routes into `features/`, resulting in to a more modular architecture.
- **Asynchronous Patterns**: Refactored the codebase to migrate cross-service asynchronous operations from RxJS Observables to `async/await` Promises.
- **REST & Agents**: Removed table blacklisting from REST and agent APIs, allowing unrestricted data access where appropriate.
- **Architectural Cleanup**: Relocated all SQLite databases to a dedicated `data/` directory and excluded them from version control to maintain a clean root.
