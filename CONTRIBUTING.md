# Contributing to Polarbase

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Polarbase as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with GitHub

We use GitHub to host code, track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## All Contributions Are Welcome

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes (`bun test` if applicable).
4. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

When you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if you'd like to discuss other arrangements.

## Report bugs using GitHub Issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/polarbase-team/polarbase/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

Great bug reports tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

- Follow the existing code style in the project.
- Run `bun run lint` or any formatter configured in the project before committing.

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the project's MIT License.

Thank you for contributing to Polarbase! ❤️
